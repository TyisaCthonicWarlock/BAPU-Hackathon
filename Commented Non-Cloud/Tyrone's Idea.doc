Tyrone has an idea for the following:
Examine the general driving patterns of all the vehicles as clusters.
After examining general driving patterns, note outliers in the vehicle's movements.
Examine how often outliers are caused by specific vehicles. 
Tyrone is assuming that if a vehicle has only a small number of outliers over a year, then the outliers may indicate the driver being in a state of high adrenaline. 
Tyrone then believes that by examining the driving pattern changes occurring during the day of occurrence for the specific vehicle, it may reveal insights on how adrenaline can influence decision-making in terms of driving, and thus, assist with location prediction.
