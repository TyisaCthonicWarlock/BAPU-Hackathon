Explanation of Scripts
Data Collection (data_collection.py):

This script loads data from several TSV files and combines them into a single DataFrame.
It also loads speed limits data and saves both combined data sets to CSV files for further use.
Data Cleaning (data_cleaning.py):

This script cleans the collected data by removing rows with missing car IDs and converting all column names to lowercase.
It saves the cleaned data to new CSV files.
Data Transformation (data_transformation.py):

This script transforms the cleaned data by extracting the date and time from the timestamp column, if it exists.
It saves the transformed data to a new CSV file.
Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py):

This script creates new features, such as categorizing the bearing into compass directions.
It saves the feature-engineered data to a new CSV file.
Model Selection and Training (model_selection.py):

This script selects and trains a RandomForestClassifier using the feature-engineered data.
It saves the trained model to a file using joblib.
Model Evaluation (training_evaluation.py):

This script evaluates the performance of the trained model using accuracy score and classification report.
It prints the evaluation metrics to the console.
Each script is designed to handle a specific step in the data processing and model training pipeline, ensuring that the data is properly prepared and the model is appropriately trained and evaluated.
